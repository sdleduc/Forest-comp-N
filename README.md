# Forest-comp-N
Forest composition data 

Goals of the project:

1. To analyze forest compositional changes due to N deposition scenarios
2. For each tree species, make maps of county level changes in mortality and biomass in both absolute and percentage terms
3. These changes will be in comparison to a baseline scenario

The data available for analysis consist of county-level, species-specific biomass and mortality for trees under different climate and nitrogen deposition scenarios for 19 Northeast and Upper Midwest U.S. states.
