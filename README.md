# Forest-comp-N
Forest composition data 

Goals of the project:

1. To analyze forest compositional changes due to N deposition scenarios out to 2100
2. For each tree species, examine county level changes in tree mortality and biomass between 2005 baseline and end of century, in both absolute and percentage terms. Boxplots will be used to visualize species-level changes with separate plots for each N scenario.

[3. Make maps of county level changes in mortality and biomass in both absolute and percentage terms]


The data available for analysis consist of county-level, species-specific biomass and mortality for 24 trees under different climate and nitrogen deposition scenarios for 19 Northeast and Upper Midwest U.S. states.
